# CPU-demo-in-CPP
Demonstrates how an 8-bit CPU works in a terminal environment. 
Based on microcontroller ATmega328P, but using dynamic memory, so that size of the memory segments can be set as needed.
The instruction set constitutes of a subset of the Atmel AVR instruction set.
Includes data memory, program memory, stack and pin change interrupts.
